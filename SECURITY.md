## Security Best Practices

When using Full Kit:

1. **Agent Credentials**: Some AI agents may store credentials or tokens in project-specific directories. Consider adding agent directories (e.g., `.claude/`, `.gemini/`, etc.) to your `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

2. **Template Security**: The templates and scripts generated by Full Kit are intended for development purposes. Review all generated code before deployment to production environments.

3. **Dependency Updates**: Keep Full Kit and its dependencies updated to ensure you have the latest security patches.

## Security Scanning

This project uses automated security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in dependencies and code.

## Code Signing

Releases of Full Kit are built and published from trusted CI/CD workflows to ensure authenticity.

## Data Handling

Full Kit does not send any data to external servers. All processing happens locally on your machine. The tool generates template files and commands for use with your chosen AI agents, but does not transmit project data itself.
