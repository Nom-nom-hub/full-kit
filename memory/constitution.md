# Project Constitution

## Goal-Driven Development Principles

### Article I: Outcome Focus
Every feature must be tied to a measurable business outcome or user benefit. No feature shall be implemented without a clear connection to business value.

### Article II: Goal Hierarchy
Goals are organized in a hierarchy from high-level strategic objectives to specific, achievable targets.

### Article III: Success Metrics
All goals must define clear, quantifiable success metrics before implementation begins.

## Blueprint-Driven Development Principles

### Article IV: Architectural Integrity
Every system component must align with the overarching architectural blueprint. No component shall be implemented without blueprint compliance.

### Article V: Design Patterns
Pre-approved architectural patterns must be used consistently across the system to ensure maintainability.

### Article VI: System Boundaries
Clear boundaries must be established between system components, with explicit interfaces and contracts.

## Spec-Driven Development Principles

### Article VII: Specification Completeness
Every implementation must be based on a complete, validated specification. No code shall be written without a corresponding specification.

### Article VIII: Implementation Fidelity
Implementations must strictly adhere to the specifications without deviation from the documented requirements.

### Article IX: Test-First Implementation
All implementations must be accompanied by comprehensive test scenarios defined in the specification phase.
